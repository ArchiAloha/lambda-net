# lambda-net



This repository contains the coder for the paper: **Î»-net: Reconstruct Hyperspectral Images from a Snapshot Measurement** (***International Conference on Computer Vision*** 2019) by Xin Miao, Xin Yuan, Yunchen Pu, Vassilis Athitsos.


The code will be posted around the end of August




## Training and testing data.

The traing and testing data used in our paper is from the paper " Sparse Recovery of Hyperspectral Signal from Natural RGB Images". It can be downlaed from http://icvl.cs.bgu.ac.il/hyperspectral/.  We romove redundant scenes in the dataset and the clean one will be uploaded through google drive soon. The training scene should be put in the file "training_data/", as mentioned in the paper the training data at least should have 80 scenes. The testing scenes should be in the file "testing_data/".


## Usage
### Download the DeSCI repository

Requirements are tensorflow, numpy, scipy.





The code will be released soon.
